A portable voice librarian for the DKI Synergy synthesizer

## Features

Native support for both MacOS and Windows. No need for a Kaypro. No
need to emulate CP/M software.

* Load virtual "carts" (CRT files).   No need for a physical
library of carts.

* Load individual "voices" (VCE files).   View their properties in a
manner similar to the original SYNHCS ".DOC" format.

* Load and save synergy "state" (SYN files).  This preserves
sequencer, portamento, vibrato and other performance customizations.

Note: Synergize does not itself include the original voice libraries -- download a copy from one of the links below.

## Thank you!

This would not have be possible without access to the copious
documentation, firmware and SYNHCS Z80 source code donated to the
community by Stoney Stockell and Mulogix, Inc.  Those are available in
several locations:

* [Synergy Facebook Users Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/synergysynth/)
* [Synergy groups.io group](https://groups.io/g/synergy-synth)
* Alex Lanterman's [Synergy Preservation Page](https://lanterman.ece.gatech.edu/synergy/)

Full sets of the DK and Mulogix library CRT and VCE files are also
available via the above links.

## TODO

Currently, Synergize can load VCE and CRT files from a preexisting
library and upload them to the Synergy. It can load and save SYN files
to and from the Synergy.  It cannot (yet) edit CRT's or VCE's.
