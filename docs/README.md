<!--# synergize-->

<img src="https://github.com/chinenual/synergize/raw/master/docs/screenshots/logo-for-github.png?raw=true"/>

A free, open-source, portable voice editor and librarian for the DKI Synergy synthesizer
with a GDS-like user interface.

## Features

* Native support for MacOS, Windows and Linux. No need for a Kaypro. No
need to emulate CP/M software.

* An optional integration with the TouchOSC tablet control surface
  gives "GDS like" faders and buttons to control the Synergize editor.

* Interfaces with both hardware Synergies and the
  [Synergia](https://jariseon.github.io/synergia) virtual Synergy -- a
  chip-level emulation of the Synergy that runs as a VST or AU virtual instrument.

* Load and create virtual "carts" (CRT files).   No need for a physical
library of carts.

* Load individual "voices" (VCE files).   View their properties in a
manner similar to the original SYNHCS ".DOC" format and the edit screens in SYNHCS.

* Edit all voice parameters (patch routing, envelopes, filters, etc.) and create new VCE files.
Edit existing voices or create your own from scratch.

* Load and save synergy "state" (SYN files).  This preserves
sequencer, portamento, vibrato and other performance customizations.

Note: Synergize does not itself include the original voice libraries -- download a copy from one of the links below.
