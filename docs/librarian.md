# Library Mode

By default, Synergize is in "Library Mode".  This allows you to view voice VCE's and cartridge CRT's and load voices into your Synergy but does not allow you to edit voice parameters.

## Voices

You can load a VCE from the `Load / Save` menu button or use the library navigator on the left of the screen to load a voice.

The right panel will show the contents of the voice.  The tabs are the same as in Voicing Mode except parameters are not editable. See the [Voicing Mode](voicing.md) chapter for details on how parameters are displayed and what they mean.

## Cartridges

You can load a CRT from the `Load / Save` menu button or use the library navigator on the left of the screen to load a cart.

The right panel will show the 24 cartridge slots with the names of each voice.  Click on any voice to drill down and view the voice's parameters.  When loaded from a cart, the voice tabs show both the Cart and Voice names (CartName / VoiceName) above the tabs.  Click the CartName to return to the Cart overview.

### Loading a CRT to the Synergy

If connected to your Synergy, you can load the contents of the cart to the Synergy with the `Load CRT` button.  This is effectively just like putting a physical cart into the Cartridge slot on the Synergy.  Once loaded, you can play any of the cart's 24 voices by selecting the appropriate Voice button on the Synergy front panel.

### Editing a CRT

You can alter the voices contained in a CRT by selecting the `Edit CRT` button. When clicked, each voice slot has a `+` and `-` button.  Click `+` to change the Voice (by selecting a VCE file), Click `-` to clear the slot so it contains nothing.

You can load the CRT "work in progress" to the Synergy with the `Load CRT` button, but be sure to `Save CRT` to preserve your edits for future use.
