# Voice Library

Synergize does not itself include the original voice libraries --
download a copy from one of the links below. 

Full sets of the DK and Mulogix library CRT and VCE files are 
available in various forms via the links listed in
[Acknowledgements](acks.md).  The set I'm using includes
the Internal voices, the 6 standard Carts and additional "Library"
voices -- it is available at: 

* [Synergy Voice Library at groups.io](https://groups.io/g/synergy-synth/files/SynergyVoiceLibrary.zip)
