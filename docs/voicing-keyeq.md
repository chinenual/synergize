## Keyboard Equalization

Keyboard equalization is  used to raise or alter groups
of 4 keys at a time with respect to volume. In additive synthesis
the ear may hear certain qualities louder or softer than they should
be for a particular instrument. The ability to raise or lower the
volume levels according to frequency range will make a more
realistic balancing of the sound. It works for modulated sounds
in the same way, but effects only the additive (listened to)
oscillators. Alterations to the modulating oscillators would
alter timbre, not desireable in this display.

Tranpose should be used 
to assure that extreme ranges are in balance with respect to
volume, especially should a user transpose a voice to a
different range during a performance patch. (This use of
transposition is also suggested when setting filter values
for the same reason).
