# Thanks and Acknowledgements

## Technical Dependencies

Synergize is free and open source software, which uses a number of other open source technologies. They include:

* Quentin Renard's excellent Go library [Astilectron](https://github.com/asticode/go-astilectron) and its related bundler and bootstrap modules.
* Sebastian Ruml's Go [osc library](https://github.com/hypebeast/go-osc).
* The [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) CSS framework
* István Ujj-Mészáros's [Touchspin](https://github.com/istvan-ujjmeszaros/bootstrap-touchspin).
* Daniel Kallin's  [nomnoml](https://github.com/skanaar/nomnoml) diagram library.
* Lodash's [debouncer](https://lodash.com/)
* [Electron](electronjs.org)
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com/)

## Original Z80 Firmware, SYNHCS source code and Voice Libraries

Synergize would not be possible without access to the excellent
documentation, and well commented firmware and SYNHCS Z80 source code
donated to the community by Stoney Stockell and Mulogix, Inc. You can
find them at a number of locations:

* [Synergy Facebook Users Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/synergysynth/)
* [Synergy groups.io group](https://groups.io/g/synergy-synth)
* Aaron Lanterman's [Synergy Preservation Page](https://lanterman.ece.gatech.edu/synergy/)
* [Synergy Voice Library at groups.io](https://groups.io/g/synergy-synth/files/SynergyVoiceLibrary.zip)

## Documentation

Thanks also to Tom Piggott for allowing me to reuse portions of his
SYNHCS documentation for this manual. Any errors introduced in the
adaptation are entirely mine.

The section describing the Patch registers (the Output, Addr and Freq
DSR's) is adapted from the firmware documentation.
