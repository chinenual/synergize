# Getting Started

## Install Synergize

### Mac

The Mac release is packaged as an installable DMG file. Open the DMG and drag Synergize the Applications folder.

### Windows

The Windows release is as a standard Windows .MSI installer. Run the installer.

### Linux

The Linux release is packaged as a simple tarball.  Untar it to a location of your choosing.

## Download the Voice Library

If you don't already have a copy of the factory CRT and VCE files, get a copy as described [here](voice-library.md).

## Settings

Use the `Help -> Preferences` menu to configure Synergize to your local setup.

### Serial Port

Set your Serial Port device here. 

### Baud Rate

Set the baud rate of your Synergy here. See [Serial Port Configuration](hardware.md) for details.

### Voice Library Location

This tells Synergize where to find your voice library (Synergize defaults your Home directory).  This will be the default location displayed in the left-pane file browser when you start Synergize.
