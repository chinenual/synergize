## Support: Issues / Bugs / Feature Requests

Please report problems or suggest new features via a [github issue](https://github.com/chinenual/synergize/issues).  If you don't have a github account, send an email to "support at chinenual.com".

Synergize logs can often help me determine what went wrong. You can
find them in the following location (depending on your OS):

* Windows: `%AppData%\Synergize\synergize.log`
* Mac: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Synergize/synergize.log`
* Linux: `$HOME/.config/Synergize/synergize.log` or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/Synergize/synergize.log`
