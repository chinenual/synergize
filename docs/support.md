## Support: Issues / Bugs / Feature Requests

Please report problems via a [github issue](https://github.com/chinenual/synergize/issues).  If you don't have a github account, send a bug report email to "support at chinenual.com"

Synergize logs can often help me determine what went wrong. You can
find them in the following location (depending on your OS):

* Windows: `%AppData%/Synergize/synergize.log`
* Mac: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Synergize/synergize.log`
* Linux: `$HOME/.config/Synergize/synergize.log` or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/Synergize/synergize.log` 

If you are a user or are thinking of becoming a user, please join our Slack workspace [https://synergize-app.slack.com](https://synergize-app.slack.com).  Send an email to "support at chinenual.com" for an invitation to the group.
