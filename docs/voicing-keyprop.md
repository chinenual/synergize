1. Click the `Key Prop` tab to select this Key Proportionality editor
2. Adjust the proportionality through the table elements.

## Keyboard Proportionality

Key proportionality is used to alter the decay rates of a sound 
on a global basis or selected oscillators at a time. Those
effected have Key Prop selected in the voice tab. It is used
for piano (to make the upper part of the keyboard decay more
quickly than the lower) and other instruments effected by
a time/decay curve. It is especially useful to make synthesizer
sounds, due to the unique nature of its activity. You could have
a long decaying drone synthesizer sound at the low end of the keyboard,
while the upper end was a sharp, plucked sound. Or you could
have a plucked bass at the lower part of the keyboard, while the
upper end has a Slowly decaying lead synthesizer sound.

A more subtle use of key proportionality is with respect to the
decay times of modulators, dependent upon frequency range. This
is especially useful in making brass sounds, where the lower
lip buzz sound is to be less exaggerated than at the top end.
